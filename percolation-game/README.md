# NVvW Demo

This folder contains an interactive demo for the [NVvW study
day](https://nvvw.nl/jaarvergadering/jaarvergadering-studiedag-2020/). That demo
has since been extended and improved. It is (at the time of writing) hosted on
<https://www.networkpages.nl/percolation-game>.

To run the demo on your own machine, try `STANDALONE=true PORT=8080 node app.js`
and then open `localhost:8080` (or use another port if you wish) in your
browser.

## Dependencies/installation

To run the demo on your own machine (as described above), you need to install
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). When done, navigate to this directory on your machine
and run `npm install`. This should install the necessary dependencies.
